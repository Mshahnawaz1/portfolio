# Project: Machine Learning Model for E-commerce Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze customer data from an e-commerce platform. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, which can then be used for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized product recommendations.

## What it does
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and normalizes numerical features.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Applies the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into meaningful clusters. The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizes the clusters using scatter plots to provide clear insights into customer behavior. 

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Tensorflow
