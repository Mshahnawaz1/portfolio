# üìå Text Summarization using T5 Model

## üöÄ Project Summary
This project implements a **state-of-the-art abstractive text summarizer** capable of handling extremely long documents using the **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)** model.  
The core innovation is a **custom preprocessing pipeline** that intelligently chunks long texts with **25-word redundancy**, ensuring contextual flow and generating a **coherent, unified summary**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Detailed Working & Methodology
- **Challenge:** T5 has a fixed context window, limiting input length.  
- **Solution:** Developed a custom pipeline:
  1. **Preprocessing & Cleaning** of raw input text.  
  2. **Intelligent Chunking** ‚Üí For documents >350 words, split into smaller segments.  
  3. **25-word Overlap (Redundancy)** ‚Üí Each chunk retains part of the previous section for contextual integrity.  
  4. **Sequential Summarization** ‚Üí T5 summarizes each chunk independently.  
  5. **Final Synthesis** ‚Üí Concatenate partial summaries into one cohesive output.  

This approach maintains **semantic cohesion** across long documents while staying within model limits.
